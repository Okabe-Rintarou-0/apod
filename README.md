      What is that light in the sky?  The answer to one of humanity's more common questions  may emerge from a few quick observations.   For example -- is it moving or blinking?  If so, and if you live near a
      <a href="ap200624.html">
       city
      </a>
      ,  the answer is typically an airplane,  since planes are so numerous and so few stars and
      <a href="ap080604.html">
       satellites
      </a>
      are bright enough  to be seen over the glare of
      <a href="https://darksky.org/what-we-do/international-dark-sky-places/">
       artificial city lights
      </a>
      .  If not, and if you live far from a city, that bright light is likely a planet such as
      <a href="ap210317.html">
       Venus
      </a>
      or
      <a href="ap180709.html">
       Mars
      </a>
      --  the former of which is constrained to appear near the horizon just before dawn or after dusk.   Sometimes the low apparent motion of a distant

       airplane

      near the horizon makes it hard to tell from a

       bright planet
      </a>

       A mere 280 light-years from Earth

      , tidally locked, Jupiter-sized exoplanet WASP-43b orbits its parent star once every 0.8 Earth days.  That puts it about 2 million kilometers (less than 1/25th the orbital distance of Mercury) from a small, cool sun.  Still, on a dayside always facing its parent star, temperatures approach a torrid 2,500 degrees F as measured at

      of the hot exoplanet's orbit, Webb measurements also show nightside temperatures remain above 1,000 degrees F.  That suggests that strong equatorial winds circulate the dayside atmospheric gases to the nightside before they can completely cool off.  Exoplanet WASP-43b is now

From the core outward, the galaxy's colors change from the yellowish light of old stars in the center to young blue star clusters and reddish star forming regions along the grand, sweeping spiral arms.  NGC 1232's apparent, small, barred-spiral companion galaxy is cataloged as NGC 1232A.  Distance estimates place it much farther though, around 300 million light-years away, and unlikely to be

      Captured in this snapshot, the shadow of the Moon came to Lake Magog, Quebec, North America, planet Earth on April 8.  For the lakeside eclipse chasers, the much anticipated total solar eclipse was a spectacle to behold in briefly dark, but clear skies.  Of course Lake Magog was one of the last places to be visited by the Moon's shadow.  The narrow path of totality for the

Applying logarithms to shift the pixel coordinates in the Hubble image relative to the center of M51 maps the galaxy's spiral arms into diagonal straight lines.  The transformed image dramatically shows the arms themselves are traced by star formation, lined with pinkish starforming regions and young blue star clusters.  Companion galaxy NGC 5195 (top) seems to alter the track of the arm in front of it though, and itself remains relatively unaffected by this unwinding of M51.  Also known as the

      <a href="https://uh.edu/engines/epi2364.htm">
       In 46 BC Julius Caesar reformed the calendar system
      </a>
      .  Based on advice by astronomer
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sosigenes_of_Alexandria">
       Sosigenes of Alexandria
      </a>
      , the Julian calendar included one
      <a href="http://scienceworld.wolfram.com/astronomy/LeapYear.html">
       leap day
      </a>
      every four years to account for the fact that an Earth year is slightly more than 365 days long.  In modern terms, the time it takes for the planet to orbit the Sun once is 365.24219 mean solar days.  So if calendar years contained exactly 365 days they would drift from the Earth's year by about 1 day every 4 years and eventually July (named for
      <a href="http://www.literaturepage.com/read/shakespeare_juliuscaesar.html">
       Julius Caesar
      </a>
      himself) would occur during the northern hemisphere winter.  By adopting a leap year with an extra day every four years,  the Julian calendar year would drift much less.  In 1582 Pope Gregory XIII provided the further fine-tuning that leap days should not occur in years ending in 00, unless divisible by 400.  This
      <a href="http://galileo.rice.edu/chron/gregorian.html">
       Gregorian Calendar
      </a>
      system is the one in wide use today.
      <a href="ap171007.html">
       Of course, tidal friction
      </a>
      in the Earth-Moon system slows Earth's rotation and gradually lengthens the day by about 1.4 milliseconds per century.  That means that
      <a href="https://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2012/02/29/the-physics-of-leap-day">
       leap days like today will not be necessary, about 4 million years from now

On June 21, the Sun's highest point and longest arc represents the longest day and the astronomical beginning of summer in the northern hemisphere.  The solstice date with the fewest hours of daylight is at the beginning of winter in the north, corresponding to the Sun's shortest and lowest arc in the 2022 solargraph.
