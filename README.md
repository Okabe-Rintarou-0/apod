Within the galactic disk, loose streamers of star forming regions lie along the galaxy's

       On January 13
      </a>
      a Full Moon and a Full Mars were close, both bright and opposite the Sun in planet Earth's sky.
      <a href="https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/skywatching/whats-up/">
       In fact
      </a>
      Mars was occulted, passing behind the Moon, when viewed from some locations in North America and northwest Africa.   As seen from Richmond, Virginia, USA, this composite image sequence follows the evening lunar occultation before, during, and after the much anticipated
      <a href="ap250115.html">
       celestial spectacle
      </a>
      .  The telescopic time series is constructed from an exposure made every two minutes while tracking the Moon over the hours encompassing the event.  As a result, the Red Planet's trajectory seems to follow a gently curved path due to the Moon's slightly different rate of apparent motion.  The next lunar occultation of bright planet Mars will be on February 9 when the moon is in a waxing gibbous phase.

       Eclipses tend to come in pairs.

      Twice a year, during an eclipse season that lasts about 34 days, Sun, Moon, and Earth can nearly align.  Then the full and new

But only rarely is the alignment at both new moon and full moon phases during a single eclipse season close enough to produce a pair with both total (or a total and an annular) lunar and solar eclipses.  More often, partial eclipses are part of any eclipse season.  In fact, the last eclipse season of 2024 produced this fortnight-separated eclipse pair:  a

Its bright coma and long dust tail were  close on the sky to the setting Sun but still easy to spot against a bright western horizon.  Over the following days, the outbound comet steadily climbs above the ecliptic and north into the darker western evening sky, but begins to fade from view.  Crossing the Earth's orbital plane around October 14, Tsuchinshan-ATLAS exhibits a noticeable

       The defining astronomical moment

      of this September's equinox is at 12:44 UTC on September 22, when the Sun crosses the celestial equator moving south in its

      in the northern hemisphere and spring in the southern hemisphere, when day and night are nearly equal around the globe.   Of course, if you celebrate the astronomical change of seasons by watching a sunrise you can also
      <a href="https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/76261/crepuscular-rays-india">
       look for crepuscular rays
      </a>
      .  Outlined by shadows cast by clouds, crepuscular rays can have a dramatic appearance in the twilight sky during any sunrise (or sunset).  Due to perspective, the parallel cloud shadows will seem to point back to the rising Sun
      <a href="ap160922.html">
       and a place
      </a>
      due east on your horizon on the equinox date.  But in this spectacular sunrise skyscape captured in early June, the parallel shadows and crepuscular rays appear to converge toward an eastern horizon's more northerly sunrise.   The well-composed photo places the rising Sun just behind the bell tower of a church in the town of Vic, province of Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain.

But on that date the full Moon could be called a seasonal Blue Moon, the third full Moon in a season with four full Moons.  And even though the

       Explanation:

      What makes this storm cloud so colorful?   First, the
      <a href="https://climatekids.nasa.gov/cloud-formation/">
       cloud
      </a>
      itself is composed of millions of tiny droplets of water and ice.   Its bottom is almost completely flat -- but this isn't unusual.
      <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-09-01/flat-bottom-clouds-and-the-science-behind-them/12591230">
       Bottom flatness in clouds
      </a>
      is generally caused by
      <a href="https://scied.ucar.edu/sites/default/files/interactives/atmosphere-altitude/vertpro_comet.jpg">
       air temperature
      </a>
      dropping as you go up, and that above a specific height,  water-saturated air condenses out water droplets.   The

       shape of the cloud
      </a>

      <a href="https://www.noaa.gov/jetstream/clouds/color-of-clouds">

      </a>
      by the cloud's water drops reflecting sunlight.  The orange color in the cloud's middle and bottom  sections are reflections of a nearly

      What is that light in the sky?  The answer to one of humanity's more common questions  may emerge from a few quick observations.   For example -- is it moving or blinking?  If so, and if you live near a
      <a href="ap200624.html">
       city
      </a>
      ,  the answer is typically an airplane,  since planes are so numerous and so few stars and
      <a href="ap080604.html">
       satellites
      </a>
      are bright enough  to be seen over the glare of
      <a href="https://darksky.org/what-we-do/international-dark-sky-places/">
       artificial city lights
      </a>
      .  If not, and if you live far from a city, that bright light is likely a planet such as
      <a href="ap210317.html">
       Venus
      </a>
      or
      <a href="ap180709.html">
       Mars
      </a>
      --  the former of which is constrained to appear near the horizon just before dawn or after dusk.   Sometimes the low apparent motion of a distant
      <a href="ap190212.html">
       airplane
      </a>
      near the horizon makes it hard to tell from a

       bright planet

      ,  but even this can usually be discerned by the plane's motion over a few minutes.

      <a href="http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_progression">

      way with increasing distance from the center.  Applying logarithms to shift the pixel coordinates in the Hubble image relative to the center of M51 maps the galaxy's spiral arms into diagonal straight lines.  The transformed image dramatically shows the arms themselves are traced by star formation, lined with pinkish starforming regions and young blue star clusters.  Companion galaxy NGC 5195 (top) seems to alter the track of the arm in front of it though, and itself remains relatively unaffected by this unwinding of M51.  Also known as the

      <a href="https://uh.edu/engines/epi2364.htm">
       In 46 BC Julius Caesar reformed the calendar system
      </a>
      .  Based on advice by astronomer
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sosigenes_of_Alexandria">
       Sosigenes of Alexandria
      </a>
      , the Julian calendar included one
      <a href="http://scienceworld.wolfram.com/astronomy/LeapYear.html">
       leap day
      </a>
      every four years to account for the fact that an Earth year is slightly more than 365 days long.  In modern terms, the time it takes for the planet to orbit the Sun once is 365.24219 mean solar days.  So if calendar years contained exactly 365 days they would drift from the Earth's year by about 1 day every 4 years and eventually July (named for
      <a href="http://www.literaturepage.com/read/shakespeare_juliuscaesar.html">
       Julius Caesar
      </a>
      himself) would occur during the northern hemisphere winter.  By adopting a leap year with an extra day every four years,  the Julian calendar year would drift much less.  In 1582 Pope Gregory XIII provided the further fine-tuning that leap days should not occur in years ending in 00, unless divisible by 400.  This
      <a href="http://galileo.rice.edu/chron/gregorian.html">
       Gregorian Calendar
      </a>
      system is the one in wide use today.

       Of course, tidal friction
      </a>
      in the Earth-Moon system slows Earth's rotation and gradually lengthens the day by about 1.4 milliseconds per century.  That means that
      <a href="https://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2012/02/29/the-physics-of-leap-day">
