      .  Launched on a SpaceX rocket on February 15, the phone booth sized lander reached lunar orbit on the 21st and touched down on the lunar surface at 6:23 pm ET on February 22nd.  Its landing region is about 300 kilometers north of the

The mission marks the first commercial uncrewed landing on the Moon.  Prior to landing, Odysseus’ camera captured this extreme wide angle image (landing legs visible at right) as it flew over
